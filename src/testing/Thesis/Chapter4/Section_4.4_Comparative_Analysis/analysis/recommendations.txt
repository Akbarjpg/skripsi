SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
=============================================

Based on analysis of 3 tests:
  - 2 anti-spoofing tests
  - 2 face recognition tests

RECOMMENDATIONS:

4. SECURITY ENHANCEMENT:
   - Increase anti-spoofing detection threshold
   - Add additional liveness detection methods
   - Implement multi-modal verification

5. GENERAL OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Implement adaptive quality settings based on hardware
   - Add progressive loading for better user experience
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
   - Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
