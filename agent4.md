# Liveness Detection Check & Fix Prompt

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Since the visual landmark detection is now working, we need to verify if the liveness detection is functioning properly. If not, implement and fix it.

## ÔøΩ STEP 1: CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

Please check the following files and report what you find:

1. **Backend Liveness Implementation:**
   - Check `src/detection/landmark_detection.py` - Does it have liveness detection methods?
   - Look for these specific functions:
     - Head pose estimation
     - Eye blink detection
     - Mouth movement detection
     - Liveness score calculation
   - Check if there's any anti-spoofing logic implemented

2. **Frontend Liveness Display:**
   - Check `src/components/FaceDetection.js` - Does it display liveness scores?
   - Is there any UI element showing liveness status?
   - Are there user instructions for liveness checks?

## üîç STEP 2: TESTING PROTOCOL

Run these tests and report the results:

### Test 1: Basic Liveness Response
1. Open the face detection page
2. Look at camera and perform these actions:
   - Turn head left and right slowly
   - Blink eyes naturally (5-10 times)
   - Open and close mouth
3. Check console/network tab for any liveness-related data
4. **REPORT:** Does any liveness score appear? Does it change with movement?

### Test 2: Anti-Spoofing Test
1. Try to fool the system with:
   - A printed photo of a face
   - A face displayed on phone/tablet screen
   - A video of a face playing on another device
2. **REPORT:** Does the system detect these as fake? What happens?

## üõ†Ô∏è STEP 3: IMPLEMENTATION (If Not Working)

If liveness detection is not working or missing, implement the following:

### A. Backend Implementation Requirements:

```python
# In landmark_detection.py or create new liveness_detection.py

class LivenessDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blink_counter = 0
        self.prev_landmarks = None
        self.movement_history = []
    
    def calculate_eye_aspect_ratio(self, eye_landmarks):
        # Calculate EAR for blink detection
        pass
    
    def detect_blinks(self, landmarks):
        # Count blinks over time
        pass
    
    def calculate_head_pose(self, landmarks):
        # Estimate yaw, pitch, roll
        pass
    
    def analyze_mouth_movement(self, landmarks):
        # Detect mouth open/close
        pass
    
    def calculate_liveness_score(self, frame_data):
        # Combine all metrics into 0-100 score
        pass
    
    def is_live_face(self, score, threshold=70):
        # Return True if score > threshold
        pass
```

### B. Required Liveness Metrics:

1. **Eye Blink Detection:**
   - Use Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) formula
   - Normal blink rate: 15-20 per minute
   - Detect consecutive frames with closed eyes

2. **Head Movement:**
   - Track nose tip and face center movement
   - Detect rotation angles (yaw, pitch, roll)
   - Natural movement patterns vs static

3. **Mouth Movement:**
   - Calculate mouth aspect ratio
   - Detect open/close states
   - Track movement frequency

4. **Anti-Spoofing:**
   - Texture analysis for print attacks
   - Motion consistency for video attacks
   - 3D depth estimation from 2D landmarks

### C. Integration Requirements:

1. **Update API endpoint** to return liveness data:
```python
{
    "landmarks": [...],
    "liveness": {
        "score": 85,
        "is_live": true,
        "metrics": {
            "blinks": 3,
            "head_movement": 15.2,
            "mouth_movement": 8.5,
            "texture_score": 92
        },
        "confidence": 0.89
    }
}
```

2. **Update Frontend** to display liveness:
```javascript
// Add to FaceDetection component
const [livenessScore, setLivenessScore] = useState(0);
const [isLive, setIsLive] = useState(false);

// Display liveness status
<div className="liveness-indicator">
    <h3>Liveness Score: {livenessScore}/100</h3>
    <div className={`status ${isLive ? 'live' : 'fake'}`}>
        {isLive ? '‚úÖ Live Face Detected' : '‚ùå Possible Spoofing Attempt'}
    </div>
</div>
```

## ÔøΩ EXPECTED OUTPUTS

After implementation, the system should:

1. **Display real-time liveness score** (0-100)
2. **Show liveness status** (LIVE/FAKE)
3. **Provide movement instructions** to users
4. **Reject static images** with <30 score
5. **Accept real faces** with >70 score
6. **Update smoothly** without lag

## üéØ DELIVERABLES

Please provide:

1. **Status Report:** Current state of liveness detection
2. **Test Results:** What works and what doesn't
3. **Implementation:** Fix/add missing liveness features
4. **Demo Video/Screenshots:** Show working liveness detection
5. **Code Changes:** List all files modified

## ‚ö° PRIORITY FIXES

If time is limited, focus on:

1. **Basic blink detection** (most important)
2. **Simple movement detection** (head turns)
3. **Basic anti-spoofing** (reject completely static images)
4. **Clear UI feedback** (show live/fake status)

**START BY:** Running the tests in Step 2 and reporting what you find. Then proceed with implementation if needed.
