# BLINK DETECTION FIX SUMMARY

## Changes Made to Fix Blink Detection Issue

### 1. Fixed Numpy Stride Error (src/models/optimized_cnn_model.py)

- Added `.copy()` to BGR to RGB conversion to fix negative stride error
- This was causing the CNN model to fail during liveness detection

### 2. Improved EAR Calculation (src/detection/landmark_detection.py)

- Simplified Eye Aspect Ratio calculation from 6-point to 4-point method
- Changed MediaPipe landmark indices to use more reliable points:
  - Left eye: [33, 133, 159, 145] (left_corner, right_corner, top, bottom)
  - Right eye: [362, 263, 386, 374] (left_corner, right_corner, top, bottom)
- Updated EAR formula to: vertical_distance / horizontal_distance

### 3. Enhanced Blink Detection Algorithm

- Lowered EAR threshold from 0.25 to 0.30 for more sensitive detection
- Reduced required consecutive frames from 3 to 2 for faster detection
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track EAR values

### 4. Improved Sequential Detection (src/web/app_optimized.py)

- Enhanced challenge handling for "Kedipkan mata 3 kali"
- Better blink counting and validation
- More responsive challenge completion

## Key Technical Details

### MediaPipe Eye Landmarks Used:

- These are the most reliable points for blink detection in MediaPipe's 468-point model
- Left Eye: Corner points (33, 133) and vertical points (159, 145)
- Right Eye: Corner points (362, 263) and vertical points (386, 374)

### EAR Calculation Method:

```python
# Simplified 4-point method:
horizontal = distance(left_corner, right_corner)
vertical = distance(top, bottom)
ear = vertical / horizontal
```

### Blink Detection Logic:

- EAR threshold: 0.30 (was 0.25)
- Consecutive frames needed: 2 (was 3)
- When EAR < threshold for 2+ frames = blink detected

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the system in sequential mode
2. Select "Kedipkan mata 3 kali" challenge
3. Look directly at camera and blink clearly 3 times
4. System should detect each blink and show count increase
5. After 3 blinks, challenge should complete successfully

## Files Modified:

- src/models/optimized_cnn_model.py
- src/detection/landmark_detection.py
- src/web/app_optimized.py
- test_blink_detection_fix.py (created for testing)

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve detection sensitivity.
