# Enhanced Anti-Spoofing System - Step 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation successfully addresses **Step 1** requirements from `yangIni.md`:

> Create a real-time face anti-spoofing detection system that runs BEFORE any attendance checking. The system should:
> 1. Capture video frames from webcam
> 2. Detect if a face is present in the frame  
> 3. Apply multiple anti-spoofing techniques simultaneously
> 4. Run continuously while a face is detected
> 5. Require user challenges and use 95% confidence threshold
> 6. Display clear instructions and progress indicators
> 7. Output Boolean (is_real_face) and confidence score
> 8. Only proceed to Phase 2 if is_real_face == True

## 🎯 Implementation Components

    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
}).then(response => response.json())
  .then(result => {
      if (result.is_real_face && result.confidence >= 0.95) {
          // Proceed to Phase 2 (Face Recognition)
          console.log('Anti-spoofing passed!');
      }
  });
```
