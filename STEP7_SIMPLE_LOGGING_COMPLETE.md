    - `step7_system_events`: System-level events
    - `step7_daily_summary`: Daily attendance summaries

#### 2. Basic Report Generator (`src/reports/basic_report_generator.py`)

- **Purpose**: Generate reports and export data for thesis documentation
- **Features**:
  - Daily and weekly attendance reports
  - CSV/JSON data export
  - HTML report generation
  - Basic statistics and charts
  - User attendance tracking
  - Export methods perfect for thesis data analysis

#### 3. Basic Admin Interface (`src/web/basic_admin_view.py`)

- **Features**:
  - Flask blueprint with admin routes
  - Dashboard showing attendance statistics
  - Daily attendance views
  - Data export functionality
  - User management interface
  - Clean, simple HTML interface

#### 4. HTML Templates

- **Files**: `templates/admin/dashboard.html`, `templates/admin/daily_attendance.html`
- **Purpose**: Simple web interface for viewing data
